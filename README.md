# Quizzify: AI-Powered Quiz Generator

Quizzify is a Streamlit-based web application designed to generate intelligent quizzes from uploaded PDFs using AI-powered embeddings and contextual information. It leverages Google Vertex AI, LangChain libraries, and a custom Chroma vector database to create dynamic, topic-specific quizzes.

## Features

- **PDF Upload and Processing**: 
  Upload multiple PDF files and process them into manageable chunks with metadata (source, page number, and unique identifier).

- **Vector Store Integration**:
  Store processed document embeddings in a Chroma vector database for efficient similarity-based retrieval.

- **AI-Generated Quizzes**:
  Dynamically generate multiple-choice quizzes based on user-defined topics and context from the uploaded documents.

- **Interactive Quiz Management**:
  Navigate between questions, view explanations, and interact with the quiz through a user-friendly interface.

## How It Works

1. **Upload PDFs**:
   - Users upload one or more PDF documents.
   - The application processes the documents into pages and splits them into chunks for embedding.

2. **Embedding and Vector Storage**:
   - Document chunks are embedded using Google Vertex AI.
   - The embeddings are stored in a Chroma vector store for later retrieval.

3. **Quiz Generation**:
   - Users provide a topic for the quiz.
   - The application uses LangChainâ€™s `PromptTemplate` and Vertex AI to generate multiple-choice questions.

4. **Quiz Interaction**:
   - Users answer questions, view explanations, and navigate between questions.
